# Global Hipoclock configuration file. This file lists only a subset
# of all parameters. For the syntax, and for a complete parameter
# list, see the hipoclockd(5) manual page (command: "man 5 hipoclockd").
#
# For common configuration examples, all you need to do is to keep the
# current "default" configuration which are configured in this file
# for more information and a complete list of available parameters
# you can visit http://www.hipoclock.org/docs/
#
# For best results, change no more than 2-3 parameters at a time,
# and test if Postfix still works after every change.
#
# NETWORK PARAMETERS
#
# the fallowing configuration are for the nerwork parameters of the 
# application
#
# BIND ADDRESS
#
# the bind address which will be used by the hipoclock deamon the 
# available configuration are "any" `hostname` or one of the
# IP address of the server, if you want several IP's use comma
# seperate value, you can use spaces between the values
#
bind_interface = any
#bind_interface = localhost
#bind_interface = 192.168.0.1, 127.0.01
#
# BIND PORTS
#
# there are 2 ports that need be bind by the Deamon , one is for the
# UPD communication and one for the TCP communication so the 2 values 
# should be configured , note that you can not spit the ports sockets
# to different address , both ports must be opened at any of specified 
# interfaces
# the TCP port is for information transport once the clients or the porxy
# server connect to the server.
# the UDP port is for a change broudcast option so the server will now 
# that a status of a relevent session element has changed.
#
bind_tcp_port = 9797
bind_udp_port = 9799
#
# SERVER HOSTNAME AND DOMAIN
#
# By default the server will check the server hostname and use it's name
# to identify it self with the other Servers/Clients. you can change this
# default value by seting a different value in the 'hostname' key 
# NOTE = the new hostname must be FQDN or by adding the parameter of 
# 'domain' to this configuration file
#
hostname = default
#hostname = newname.domain.local
#hostname = newname
#hostname_domain = domain.local
#
# by default the domain is the prefix domain which is cut from the `hostname -d`
# command. the domain option allows the admin to use a different domain.
# this configuration is very important when using TLS due to the need of a
# valid FQDN when initiating a TLS socket.
#
# is you set the hostname option as an FQDN then the domain will be cut 
# from that option unless you speficied otherwise in this option.
#
domain = default
# domain = example.com
# domain = site1.example.com
#
# TLS/SSL CONFIGURATION
#
# the hipoclock application can and should work through Secure Socket Layer
# to make sure the information going from the both the server and the client
# are secure. for that porpase the server should configure the CA certificate
# the Key certificate and the certificate it self.
#
# by default the server/client communication is over clear text, in order to
# activate the TLS the following parameters should be uncomment and a CA certificte
# should be created
#
# use_tls = yes
# tls_ca_file = /etc/hipoclock/ca.crt
# tls_key_file = /etc/hipoclock/server.key
# tls_certificate = /etc/hipoclock/server.crt
#
# DATABASE CONNECTION
#
# this section is for the database connection settings , there are 2 types
# of database connection , the first is sqlite which is the default database
# the hipoclock is using and the second option is connecting to a database
# using ODBC
database_type = sqlite
database_sqlite_file = $hipovar/hipoclockd.sl3
#
# ODBC
#
# for odbc uncomment the following lines , you need to make sure the database
# is prebuild before you start the daemon , well known database schemas can
# be found in the website or in the package source code or even in the doc 
# directory
#
# when working with ODBC it is important to mention that you need to edit your
# owen odbc.ini file , the main system if resides in /etc/odbc.ini.
# you can work with your own file by setting the ODBCINI environment variable
# at the hipoclock environment file
#
# database_type = odbc
# database_odbc_dsn = mysql
# database_odbc_dsn = postgresql
# database_odbc_dsn = oracle
#
